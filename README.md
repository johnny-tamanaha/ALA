    4. det -> determinant of a matrix    
    5. coimg -> coimage of a matrix    
    6. img -> image of a matrix    
    7. ker -> kernel of a matrix   
    8. coker -> cokernel of a matrix   
    9. fss -> four fundemental subspaces of a matrix  
    10. qr -> QR decomposition on a square matrix 
    11. solvex -> solve Ax=b
